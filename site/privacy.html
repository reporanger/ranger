    <h4 id="general-information">General Information</h4>
    <p>
      Ranger is owned and operated by Dawn Labs LLC. Ranger ("we", "us" or "our") applies this
      policy to the Subscriber (the "Subscriber", "user", you" or "your"). By using Ranger, you
      expressly consent to the data handling practices described in this notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect no information of those who sign up to Ranger apart from the name of the repo that
      Ranger is installed into and aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit,
      and information volunteered by the consumer. The information we collect is used to improve the
      content of our web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to
      other organisations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've
      requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
          regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the
          physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We transfer information about you if Ranger is acquired by or merged with another company.
          In this event, Ranger will notify you before information about you is transferred and
          becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 id="information-gathering-and-usage">Information Gathering and Usage</h4>

      and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement,
      contact, and research.

      is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h4 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h4>
    <p>
      Ranger uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware,

          permission to access their source code in order to provide support.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ranger does not store GitHub credentials. Using GitHub apps means we do not access your
          GitHub password and that you can revoke our access at any time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ranger uses certificate authentication with GitHub to obtain a temporary token in order to
          create branches and open pull requests.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 id="data-security">Data Security</h4>

      the security of any information you transmit to Ranger, and you do so at your own risk. We
      cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
      by breach of any of our safeguards, however, we make industry reasonable efforts to ensure the
      security of our systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find a vulnerability, please report it to us immediately at
      <a href="mailto:ranger@dawnlabs.io">ranger@dawnlabs.io</a>. We ask that you do not publicly

    </p>
    
    <h4 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h4>

      of any changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
    </p>
    <p>

      placing a prominent notice on our site.
